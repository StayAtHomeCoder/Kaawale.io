## Developer Guide

This section provides information of interest to Meteor developers wishing to use this code base as a basis for their own development tasks.

### Installation
First, install Meteor.

Second, visit the StayAtHomeCoder application GitHub page and click the “Use this template” button to create your own repository initialized with a copy of this 
application. Alternatively, you can download the sources as a zip file or make a fork of the repo. Then, download a copy of the repo to your local computer.

Third, cd into the app/ directory and install libraries with:

```$ meteor npm install```

Fourth, run the system with:

```$ meteor npm run start```

If it all goes well, the application will appear at http://localhost:3000.

### Quality Assurance - ESLint

The application includes a .eslintrc file to define the coding style adhered to in this application. You can invoke ESLint from the command line as follows:

```$ meteor npm run lint```

ESLint should run without generating any errors.

It’s significantly easier to do development with ESLint integrated directly into your IDE (such as IntelliJ).
